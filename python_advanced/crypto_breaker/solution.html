          Background: The show follows the misadventures of three friends, Ilan,
          Kobi and Oded, as they move from Netanya to Tel Aviv to launch their
          band. Unlike many shows, the characters in the show are aware that
          they are on television; the show features their day-to-day lives. A
          major aspect of the show is "HaMasach HaLavan" (the white screen),
          where cast members talk to the viewers. Gary also talks to the viewers
          when he is alone, often complaining about his wife or just his life in
          general. There are several interactive episodes, such as an episode
          which the viewers can fast forward or rewind to decide the outcome of
          the episode, an episode which the viewers can record ringtones, and an
          episode with a cheaper form of scratch-and-sniff. The show always ends
          with Shtifat Kelim (washing the dishes); the characters washing the
          dishes for Gary and summarize the episode. Seasons The first season of
          the show debuted on 1 July 2003 and included 23 episodes. The season
          ended in a special episode called "My Favorite Episode". Because the
          show attracted a large number of viewers, The Kids Channel decided to
          order another two seasons, which were written and filmed together. The
          second season debuted on 28 March 2004 and included 19 episodes. That
          season ended with a special episode called "The Gold Pyjamas". The
          third season of the show premiered on 1 July 2004 and included 20
          episodes. The season ended with two special episodes, a documentary
          episode called "Only The Truth" and a trivia contest about the third
          season called "This That or That This". After the third season ended,
          The Kids Channel decided to stop the series, because Alona Tal had
          left for the US, and the trio filmed a new show on The Music Channel.
          A year later, The Kids Channel decided to film a new season in
          response to high VOD viewing numbers. Alona Tal stayed in the US (but
          guest starred in five episodes), and the production team picked Yamit
          Sol to effectively replace her. Yuval Segal, who played Ilan's cousin
          in three episodes in season two, joined the main cast. This season
          debuted on 13 August 2006 and included 25 episodes. In December 2007
          The Kids Channel ordered another season.
